                <p style="font-size:12px;">Learning and studying software and computer science has always been a goal and an interest for me. This has created the basis for my career goal, to major in the field of computer science. My hope is to help innovate the lives of people with new software and to help solve issues that we may run into now. In order to achieve this career goal, I have previously taken the course, AP computer science principles, am a member of the Engineering Academy at Dublin High, and am currently taking Honors Principles of Engineering.

          To enter into the field of computer science, I have brought with me a number of experiences in past extracurricular activities that may help me. I believe I carry the traits, cooperative and open-minded, which I have developed through attending a program called the Youth International Business Initiative. This program involved groups creating start-up businesses and models that were used to compete in a business start-up competition. Through this experience, I learned how to listen to everybody's opinions, compromise during disagreements, and try different ideas no matter the predicted outcome. I also believe I carry the trait of ambition, or in other words, desire and determination to be successful. During this start-up competition, there were many challenges in creating the ideal business model and plan. However, through much effort and persistence, my team and I eventually made it to the top two teams that were able to move on to the international Final round, set to occur in the summer of 2020, but was cancelled due to COVID-19. Although these experiences are not directly related to my career goal, I believe the skills I have gained from these experiences will help me in the field of computer science.

          As a sophomore at Dublin High School, I am currently serving a second term on the City of Dublin Mayor's Council as a project manager. From the experience of being on the Dublin Mayor's Council, I have learned that I enjoy working with others to help build a better community in the city that I live in. As an athlete, I am participating in my second year of being on both the Dublin High School hip hop dance team and swim team. In the previous hip hop season, I accomplished getting first place at the state and national championships with my Hip Hop team. Additionally, through my efforts of balancing my role as a student and role as an athlete, I have achieved the Scholar Athlete Award from my school. From my experience as an athlete at Dublin High, I have learned that working with others to achieve a common goal is the most effective solution, and I hope to carry on this knowledge into my future career.

          I hope that my past experiences and my future decisions will help me achieve my career goal as a computer science major and I hope I can help everyone around me with my future computer science abilities. Thank you for your time and please enjoy the rest of my online portfolio.
