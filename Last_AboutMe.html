                <p style="font-size:12px;">Learning and studying software and computer science has always been a goal and an interest for me. This has created the basis for my career goal, to major in the field of computer science. My hope is to help innovate the lives of people with new software and to help solve issues that we may run into now. In order to achieve this career goal, I am currently enrolled in the class, computer science principles, and I will be a part of the engineering academy in my sophomore year at Dublin High School.

            <br>
          To enter into the field of computer science, I have brought with me a number of experiences in past extracurricular activities that may help me. I believe I carry the traits, cooperative and open-minded, which I have developed through attending a program called the Youth International Business Initiative in December of 2019. This program involved groups creating start-up businesses and models that were used to compete in a business start-up competition. Through this experience, I learned how to listen to everybody's opinions, compromise during disagreements, and try different ideas no matter the predicted outcome. I also believe I carry the trait of ambition, or in other words, desire and determination to be successful. During this start-up competition, there were many challenges in creating the ideal business model and plan. However, through much effort and persistence, my team and I eventually made it to the top two teams that were able to move on to the international Final round, occurring in the summer of 2020. Although these experiences are not directly related to my career goal, I believe the skills I have gained from these experiences will help me in the field of computer science.

          I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School, and so far during my freshman year, I have accomplished making it on to the City of Dublin Mayor's Council, and I have accomplished getting first place at States and Nationals while on the Dublin High Junior Varsity Hip Hop team. From the experience of being on the Dublin Mayor's Council, I have learned that I enjoy working with others to help build a better community in the city that I live in. From my experience on the Dublin High Hip Hop team, I have learned that working with others to achieve a common goal is something that I want to continue to do and I also learned that working as a team is the most effective way to achieve a goal. 
          <br>

          I hope that my past experiences and my future decisions will help me achieve my career goal as a computer science major and I hope I can help everyone around me with my future computer science abilities. Thank you for your time and please enjoy the rest of my online portfolio.
