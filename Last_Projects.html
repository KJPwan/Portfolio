          <p>The objective of this project was to create an entertaining and challenging game in Scratch. With the help of my partner, the game has a simplistic aesthetic that involves a character, a cute, grey cube-like blob, that is supposed to jump over red bars on the ground to get to the other side and touch the yellow circle. The game includes challenging obstacles that the blob can maneuver through using the arrow keys. My role in this project was to design and create the levels of the game, pick out bugs in the code, and program a part of the blob's movement forward. Challenges my partner and I overcame during the project were, the backdrop not aligning correctly with the game which resulted in us redoing the backdrops, difficulty fixing the issue of the blob jumping too far up, and the blob sliding forward when nothing was pressed. Throughout the project, my partner and I worked well without conflicts mainly because we established what we each should do and gave good feedback and commentary to eachother. This project taught me how to problem solve with experimentation in programming, along with how to use block-based programming.

        <p style="color:pink;">September 2019 - October 2019, Computer Science Principles</p><br>
        <p> The objective of this project was to creatively add on to an already existing MIT App Inventor app. The game/app my partner and I added on to was "Get the Gold". The object of the game was to collect as much gold as possible using your finger to swipe the pirate ship in the direction you want it to go to. The backdrop of the game was changed, we created an endless mode, added a feature so the user could see how many coins they had, and improved the speed of the ship. My role in this project was to try to figure out how to program the power ups, create an app cover page, and debug the project after each stage. Challenges my partner and I faced and overcame were, the ship reacting too slow to the user's movement, the ship not moving fast enough, and the coins appearing too far on the edges of the screen. My partner and I collaborated smoothly on this project, we helped eachother out when we needed help on our parts and worked on parts of the project based on our individual strengths and skills. From this project, I learned how to add on basic features to an MIT App Inventor app along with the general idea of how an app should be created to be more appealing to a user. <br>

        <p style="color:pink;">February 2021 - March 2021, Honors Principles of Engineering</p><br>
        <p> The objective of this project was to determine recyclable materials and transform them into whole new products in order to benefit the environment. My team created three products in our product line, Eco-Clo, and each product creatively used old clothing to create a daily necessity. The product I created was a cloth tote bag made out of upcycled pants. The unique feature of the bag was, the bag handles were created out of old belts and were changeable occording to the weight needed to be carried or occasion. My specific role in the project was the Project Manager. As the project manager, I organized and updated the Gantt chart daily, made sure all of my teammates completed everything on time, organized our documentation and presentation, edited our video pitch, and reminded my teammates of due dates and tasks that needed to be completed. This project broadened my knowledge about the fast fashion industry as well as the recycling process for different types of fabric and clothing items, from old pants to leather belts. I also learned about elasticity material testing and how to strategically choose materials depending on the purpose of the material and the product. This project was completely done over distance-learning, which did cause certain challenges to appear. The biggest challenge was communication and ensuring each teammate was on the same page regarding time constraints and what tasks still needed to be finished. However, with cooperation from each team member, we were able to overcome this challenge and make compromises with patience, forgiveness, and empathy, which was personally, the biggest take away from this project. <br>

        <p style="color:pink;">March 2021 - April 2021, Honors Principles of Engineering</p><br>
        <p> The objective of this project was to use the application "Bridge Designer 2016" and create a truss bridge that was as sturdy and cheap as possible. We were given the materials carbon Steel, high-strength low-Alloy Steel, and quenched and tempered steel as well as the option to adjust arch abutment heights, number of piers, and cable anchorages. The goal was for us students to experiment with the resources given to us to create our final bridge design. I learned how to successfully operate the "Bridge Designer" software and build and test bridges. We explored the real world application of trusses and how different forces affect the ability of trusses to support the weight of a truck. I was the project manager in my group and I edited and and organized the documentation and presentation and sent out reminders for deadlines and tasks that needed to be completed. With distance-learning, the largest challenge my team encountered was not being able to immedietly see each other's bridges and tests, making us unsure of how our bridges performed relative to everyone else's bridges in the group. The way we combatted this challenge was by having virtual meetings outside of class time and sharing screens in the meeting. <br>
