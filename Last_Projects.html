          <p>The objective of this project was to create an entertaining and challenging game in Scratch. With the help of my partner, the game has a simplistic aesthetic that involves a character, a cute, grey cube-like blob, that is supposed to jump over red bars on the ground to get to the other side and touch the yellow circle. The game includes challenging obstacles that the blob can maneuver through using the arrow keys. My role in this project was to design and create the levels of the game, pick out bugs in the code, and program a part of the blob's movement forward. Challenges my partner and I overcame during the project were, the backdrop not aligning correctly with the game which resulted in us redoing the backdrops, difficulty fixing the issue of the blob jumping too far up, and the blob sliding forward when nothing was pressed. Throughout the project, my partner and I worked well without conflicts mainly because we established what we each should do and gave good feedback and commentary to eachother. This project taught me how to problem solve with experimentation in programming, along with how to use block-based programming. <br> Project documentation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7-_LIFVj8_babo5j63846J8-1GJBKH-6wh1cOetsBY/edit">Documentation</a>

        <p style="color:pink;">September 2019 - October 2019, Computer Science Principles</p><br>
        <p> The objective of this project was to creatively add on to an already existing MIT App Inventor app. The game/app my partner and I added on to was "Get the Gold". The object of the game was to collect as much gold as possible using your finger to swipe the pirate ship in the direction you want it to go to. The backdrop of the game was changed, we created an endless mode, added a feature so the user could see how many coins they had, and improved the speed of the ship. My role in this project was to try to figure out how to program the power ups, create an app cover page, and debug the project after each stage. Challenges my partner and I faced and overcame were, the ship reacting too slow to the user's movement, the ship not moving fast enough, and the coins appearing too far on the edges of the screen. My partner and I collaborated smoothly on this project, we helped eachother out when we needed help on our parts and worked on parts of the project based on our individual strengths and skills. From this project, I learned how to add on basic features to an MIT App Inventor app along with the general idea of how an app should be created to be more appealing to a user. <br>
