  <p> During my time in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School, I have been given the opportunity to meet numerous industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. Each field trip and guest speaker has given me a unique perspective into the growing field of engineering and science. Simultaneously, each opportunity has broadened my vision for my future position in the industry. </p>

        <p>In February of 2020, I got the opportunity to go on a field trip to the Google Headquarters. It was a great chance to see the Google campus and what the work environment looked like. During the field trip, I watched a Google Talk featuring producer Jenny Buccos and Kari Byron, who have previously been on MythBusters and are currently working on the show "Crash Test World". I got the chance to hear about how the two had created "Crash Test World" together and what inspired them to keep going. It was interesting to hear that their main drive was to educate children on the many aspects of of our world and to understand real world applications. The most memorable part of the field trip was getting the opportunity to personally speak with Kari Byron about how she became a Television host and how she got to where she is now. She advised me to come out of my comfort zone in order to achieve the goals that I want and to focus on accomplishing my dreams. In February 2021, I attended a virtual field to Roche, A multinational healthcare company, guided by Marintha Heil and Beteil Haile. The focus of the field trip was on the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic. We heard from various scientists at Roche about their perspectives in the laboratory from the start of the pandemic to now. One of the most memorable stories was from Dr. Jingtao Sun. He is a research leader at Roche and was in China when the first COVID-19 cases emerged. He described the experience of having to communicate with his colleagues in California to start the development for the COVID-19 assay while he was stuck in China. Marintha Heil and Beteil Haile then went into the steps of having an assay approved for use and showed pictures and videos of each part of the process. It was an amazing opportunity to learn about what goes on behind the scenes in the laboratory during pandemics like the one we have all experienced.   </p>

      <p>In November of 2019, I got the opportunity to listen to a presentation given by guest speaker Shawn Mehaffey who has worked at Chevron as a programmer analyst. From his presentaion, I learned that technology has advanced quickly throughout the years and is continuing to advance at a high rate. I also learned that I must have skills such as analytical thinking and problem-solving in order to be successful in a field involving technology because of the fast progression. I was inspired to pursue a career in this field after hearing about how much society needs people in this career and how much being a programmer can help others. In November of 2019, I got the chance to hear a presentation from Guest Speaker Devon Martin who worked at Chevron as a professional software engineer. We got to hear what a typical day was like for a software engineer and also what he learned from his time working. His presentation taught me many things about the software engineering career such as worrying less about not knowing programming languages and focusing more on what you want to accomplish. His presentation also taught me to utilize the resources I already have and to continue learning different languages to help me in the future. After hearing about his career, I was inspired by how much he continues to learn about programming everyday just from working, and how many things you can do with programming knowledge and skills.<br>

      In February of 2021, I was able to listen to Kenny Lau, a Dublin High Alumni,speak on his engineering journey through high school and in college. He spoke on his experience being a computer engineering major and what he liked and disliked about it, then about his transition to being a computer science major. I was able to gain vauble insight into some of the key steps I could take as an aspiring engineer in high school. For example, Kenny suggested attending hackathons, as they were able to give him adequate experience with programing and not only taught him more about coding, but also how to effectively work with a team he may not be familiar with. He ended the talk with some advice for high school students and opened my eyes to how vital it is to both strive for the best and have fun. In March of 2021, I was able to attend another Alumni Talk where Trish Shah spoke about her experience as a college student in the technology field. Trish is majoring in a fairly new major called Management Information Systems. This major combines technology and business and is a very flexible major that can be applied to many fields. The biggest takeaways from Trishâ€™s talk were the college survival tips she gave to us. One of the important suggestions Trish told us was to make sure we have good time management. This means to select classes at times that are best for us and to make sure we allocate time in between classes to complete assignments. Another important suggestion was to have fun and take risks. It is important to let loose and savour our moments in college. The most important suggestion Trish told us was to check-in with ourselves and make sure to put our mental health first, which applies to both college and high school.
