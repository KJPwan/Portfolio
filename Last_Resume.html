    <h4>Field Trips</h4>
      <p>In February of 2020, I got the opportunity to go on a field trip to Google Headquarters. It was a great chance to see the Google campus and what the work environment looked like. During the field trip, I got to see a Google Talk featuring producer Jenny Buccos and Kari Byron, who had previously been on MythBusters and is currently working on Crash Test World. I got the chance to hear about how the two had created Crash Test World together and what inspired them to keep going. It was interesting to hear that their main drive was to educate children on the many aspects of of our world and to understand real world applications. The most memorable part of the field trip was getting the opportunity to personally speak with Kari Byron about how she became a Television host and how she got to where she is now. She taught me to come out of my comfort zone to achieve the things that I want and to focus on doing the things I want.  </p>

    <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
      <p>In November of 2019, I got the opportunity to listen to a presentation given by guest speaker Shawn Mehaffey who has worked at Chevron as a programmer analyst. From his presentaion, I learned that technology has advanced quickly throughout the years and is continuing to advance at a high rate. I also learned that I must have skills such as analytical thinking and problem-solving in order to be successful in a field involving technology because of the fast progression. I was inspired to pursue a career in this field after hearing about how much society needs people in this career and how much being a programmer can help others. <br>

      In November of 2019, I got the chance to hear a presentation from Guest Speaker Devon Martin who worked at Chevron as a professional software engineer. We got to hear what a typical day was like for a software engineer and also what he learned from his time working. His presentation taught me many things about the software engineering career such as worrying less about not knowing programming languages and focusing more on what you want to accomplish. His presentation also taught me to utilize the resources I already have and to continue learning different languages to help me in the future. After hearing about his career, I was inspired by how much he continues to learn about programming everyday just from working, and how many things you can do with programming knowledge and skills.<br>

      In February of 2021, I was able to listen to Kenny Lau, a Dublin High Alumni, speak on his engineering journey through high school and in college. He spoke on his experience being a computer engineering major and what he liked and disliked about it, then about his transition to being a computer science major. I was able to gain vauble insight into some of the key steps I could take as an aspiring engineer in high school. For example, Kenny suggested attending hackathons, as they were able to give him adequate experience with programing and not only taught him more about coding, but also how to effectively work with a team he may not be familiar with. He ended the talk with some advice for high school students and opened my eyes to how vital it is to both strive for the best and have fun.
